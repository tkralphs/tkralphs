# Hi there üëã, I'm Ted! 

I'm a code geek ü§ì and open source enthusiast with a day job as a professor in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://ise.lehigh.edu). I'm the technical lead for the [COIN-OR Foundation](https://github.com/coin-or) and the director of the [Laboratory for Computational Optimization Research @ Lehigh](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu). I've spent two decades developing and maintaining many of the open source packages in [COIN-OR](https://github.com/coin-or). If you appreciate the existence of high-quality, open source solvers, you can [buy me a üç∫](https://github.com/sponsors/tkralphs)! Work and life pull me in a lot of directions, but I'm always looking for a way to show some more ‚ù§Ô∏è to my open source projects, making the world a better place, one line of code at a time. To learn more about me, check me out on [the Internets](https://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~ted).
